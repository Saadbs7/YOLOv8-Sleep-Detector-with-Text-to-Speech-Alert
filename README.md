# YOLOv8-Sleep-Detector-with-Text-to-Speech-Alert
This repository contains code for a real-time sleep detection system using YOLOv8 object detection and a webcam feed. The detector can identify whether a person's eyes are open or closed and determine if they are awake or asleep. When the system consistently detects closed eyes, it triggers a text-to-speech alert saying "Be Alert!".
